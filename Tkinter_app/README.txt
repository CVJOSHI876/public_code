A video demonstrating how this code works is at https://youtu.be/X3xtzM0m4GU
The code (AnalysisApp.py) is written for Python 2.7
You can simply run the code (>python AnalysisApp.py)
Then choose "demo.xlsx" when the file select window comes up
To actually build the app you need to run "build.sh" which runs "setup.py"
